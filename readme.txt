Manage one widget area at a time to maintain widget sanity.

== Description ==

If you have ever needed to accommodate a client's request to have separate widget areas for many sections of the site, you understand the need for this plugin.

This plugin alleviates the pain of having many sidebar widget areas by hiding all but one (that is selectable via a dropdown). Gone are the days of trying to drag a new widget from the left column to a widget area at the bottom of the right column (ugh!).

There is no configuration for this plugin.
