Modifies Jetpack's default slideshow caption feature.

== Description ==

Jetpack has a pretty robust Image slideshow feature. (If you don't know, "Add Media" button > "Create Gallery" > Choose photos > "Create new gallery" > Change type to slideshow in "Gallery Settings" > "Insert Gallery")

Jetpack's handling of photo's captions doesn't work well with long captions (as it overlays the caption above the photo). This plugin modifies the layout so that the caption is displayed below the photo and the slideshow expands to accommodate.

--------------------------

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `jetpack-slideshow-caption` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. While editing an entry: "Add Media" button > "Create Gallery" > Choose photos > "Create new gallery" > Add captions to photos > Change type to slideshow in "Gallery Settings" > "Insert Gallery"

== Screenshots ==

1. Caption is displayed below the photo.
