WDS Widget Sidebar Management
==============================

If you have ever needed to accommodate a client's request to have separate sidebars for many sections of the site, you understand the need for this plugin.

This plugin alleviates the pain of having many sidebar widget areas by hiding all but one (that is selectable via a dropdown). Gone are the days of trying to drag a new widget from the left column to a sidebar at the bottom of the right column (ugh!).

There is no configuration for this plugin.

1. New and hawt.

2. Old and busted.

3. Sidebar scrolls with you. No more trying to drag outside of the viewing area.
